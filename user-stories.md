###Project User Stories:

As a part of the marketing research team, I need a tool to accurately collect and chart feedback from potential customers in order to decide which products are most likely to sell.

As a developer, I want to make an adaptable program to randomly generate images and react to user clicks because this we want to easily measure customer input and account for adding new items to the store catalogue.

As a user to the site, I want a visually appealing interface that doesn't have too much clutter because I want to have a streamlined and efficient browsing process.
